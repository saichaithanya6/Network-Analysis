## Introduction and Goals
Wes Anderson writes and directs films with an instantly-recognizable style. From the powder blue uniforms in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou to the retro pastels in The Grand Budapest Hotel, as well as the recurrence 
of lead actors like Bill Murray and Owen Wilson, filmgoers instantly recognize continuities between the otherwise unrelated stories in his films.

With this summer’s release of his latest project, Asteroid City, this is a perfect time to explore the networks arising from these recurring casts and see what they can tell us about each films similarities and differences.
This report will contrast the Wes Anderson network with an equivalent network based on Steven Spielberg films, which serve as a sort of baseline representing a more a typical body of film (albeit an extremely successful one).
Throughout this report, wa_ and ss_ prefixes denote each director’s data sets.

Given the bimodal undirected nature of these networks, we focus on three types of analysis:

* Part A: Network-level metrics

* Part B: Centrality and node importance

* Part C: Communities and subgroups
